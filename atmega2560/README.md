PARTS:
    1. INLAND Mega 2560
    2. ADAFRUIT BME280 temp/humid/pressure sensor
    3. ADAFRUIT STEMMA QT JST PH soil sensor (must be compatible with BME280)
    4. STEMMA QT connector cable
    Some sort of display module (few in inventory)
    (POSSIBLE) DS18B20 temperature sensor
    (POSSIBLE) Gravity Analog pH metre kit

ROUGH IDEA:

The idea is to use the 2560 board to interface with the BME sensor. 
The BME sensor will read its environments values and will have a 
STEMMA QT compatible sensor attachment (possibly the JST PH & or DS18B20 sensor). 
The JST PH soil moisture sensor will display generic readings 
200 (very dry) to 2000 (very wet) 
which may be able to be converted to meaningful values with units of measurement. 
The JST PH soil moisture sensor will also provide temperature readings. 
The DS18B20 can possibly be used to read the temperature of the soil as well. 
The gravity analog pH metre kit can possibly be used to measure the soils 
pH levels but may require some extra work (diluted sample of soil in water 
then test with meter). The values will be pulled using possibly both ardiuno
and python code and communicating with the hardware over the I2C protocol. 
In the future post-prototype stage, I will look into implementing a MongoDB 
to house the values and display them in an organized fashion on a webpage. 
The readings from the various sensors will also be displayed
on an inland 16x02 LCD module...
    
    - Using breadboards, wire 2560 to 280 and the 280 to the 3rd party attachments
    - Mega 2560 will be main module interfacing with sensors
    - BME280 will read its environments press/humid/temp
    - soil meter will read moisture of soil & temp
    - DS18B20 may be able to read soil temp more accurately
    - Pull readings from 280, soil meter, and DS18B20
        - using arduino & python code to verify hardware addresses to
        communicate using I2C protocol (which uses less pins than SPI) as well as to pull data 
        and house readings in a MONGO DB 
            - categorize results from BME280 (TEMP/HUMID/PRESSURE)
                - possibly some math to be done to caculate other climate variables
            - categorize results from ADAFRUIT soil meter (generic 200-2000 val & temp)
                - calculate generic vals into measurable units
                - possible math to calculate other variables
            - categorize results from DS18B20 (TEMP)
            * some possible math to calculate other variables when taking all 
            * sensors readings into consideration
        - publish readings from MONGO DB to a website...
            - use python to create some sort of API to request data and display it on the webpage
            - display graphs/trends of values...
        - publish readings to some sort of LCD module...

- more ideas and details will come as time does
